  <body><p>Late night, post-debate non-fancy update.</p>

<p>After I saw Trump's bullshit insult "nasty woman" I knew that people would grab domain names. I am delighted to see that the HRC campaign got "http://nastywomengetshitdone.com" and are redirecting it to her campaign website.
    </p>
<p>I bought 'nastywomenunite.com', 'nastywomenunite.org', 'nastywomenvote.com', and 'nastywomenvote.org' because a) I wanted to make sure that the troglodytes in orange didn't get them and b) I know a lot of brilliant, activist women in the US who might make use of them. I have zero interest in doing anything with them because I am both lazy and not-an-american. I take very seriously the prohibition against foreign interference in domestic elections ('Hi Vladimir, I can't see your country from my house but I'm much further south than Sarah') and I have no interest in fucking with that. I just bought some domain names. But I'd be happy to transfer those domain names _at exact cost I paid so there's no argument I am donating (OR that I'm profitin)g to people I think will use them for good. 
    </p>
    <p>If you're the Clinton campaign and know a legit way for me to transfer these to you, please email nastyowmen@karamcnair.com. If you're someone else who I can get these to who can also avoid illegal activity, please email canuckistan@karamcnair.com. 
      ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
